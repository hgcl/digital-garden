# Every Note Should Have Three Types of Links

Houtz argues that every note of a [[zettelkasten-method]] should link to at least three types of notes:

1. Upwards — link to a more general idea. For example, this current note can link to [[tk-how-to-connect-notes]].
2. Downwards — link to a more specific idea. For example, the `[[zettelkasten-method]]` note can point to `[[literature-notes]]`.
3. Laterally — link to a related topic. These related topics are the ones that would typically crop up in the "See also" section of a note.
