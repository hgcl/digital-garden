# Magician

In the context of growth, the *magician* is a term coined by Autotranslucence in [[becoming-a-magician-2018]]. 

A magician is someone with skills and competences that are so much above yours, that you cannot imagine how they do what they doâ€”in other words, it is *magic* to your eyes.

Magicians wear a lens that is completely different from yours. To become that magician, it is not enough to get better in a linear way, you need to have a lens shift as well.

Chances are that you are also the magician of someone else. Would younger you be able to imagine where you are in life currently?
