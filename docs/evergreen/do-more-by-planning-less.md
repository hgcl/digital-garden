# Do More By Planning Less

_Tags: #evergreen_

Like [Zain Rizvi](https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/do-more-by-doing-less/), I have a short motivation span for "fun projects". I also tend to overthink and overengineer projects, making them much more complex than what they are. 

Therefore, by decomplexifying a project—or better, not complexifying them in the first place—I can definitely improve my odds of completing it.

The key question is to keep in mind the _real goal_ of the project... and kill all the fluff.
