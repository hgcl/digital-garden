# What Is An Outline?

_Tags: #evergreen_

All notes of this digital garden are organised under outlines. An outline is a note representing a strong interest that I want to deepen. Its title can therefore be formulated as an objective.

Once having left the inbox, all notes should be directly or undirectly linked to an outline.
