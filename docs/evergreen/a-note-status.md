# Phases Of A Note

_Tags: #evergreen_

## inbox

The `#inbox` tag gathers all transient notes, drafts and fleeting ideas (that I don't want to be fleeting anymore). All the notes I produce from reading articles or watching videos begin here.

## tk (to come)

I usually reference interesting concepts inside of my `#inbox` notes directly. This creates new empty `#tk` notes that are waiting to be fleshed out—or possibly deleted.

## evergreen

An `#evergreen` note is considered completed.

It is possible to update an evergreen note, but it will have already been fleshed out at least once.

## outline

All `#evergreen` notes should stem—directly or indirectly—from an `#outline` note. An outline should represent a strong interest that I want to deepen. Its title can therefore be formulated as an objective.
