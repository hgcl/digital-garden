# Capsule Wardrobe

_Tags: #evergreen_

The term *capsule wardrobe* is used for the first time by Susie Faux in the 70s. She described it as a collection of clothing items that don't go out of fashion. This base collection could be adorned with seasonal items as well.

Nowadays, a capsule wardrobe describes a collection of matching permutable clothing items, therefore maximising the number of possible outfits.

With fewer items, it is then possible to have an outfit for all occasions.
