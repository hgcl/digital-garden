## Slowly building the habit

Week 2! This already feels like an achievement. Confession: I do have a history of giving up on exciting new resolutions pretty quickly.

## Doing yoga

Talking about habits, I have been following [30 Days of Yoga Camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4iSb1bDQq8&list=PLui6Eyny-Uzx5BRNB2_Kvycrn5h9OsaHC) since the beginning of lockdown in Berlin on November 2nd. 

I have been consistently doing 30–40 minutes yoga almost every day. I like the monthly format that allows daily progress and continuity. 

Adriene must also be one of the sweetest yoga teachers on the internet. Definitely much more beginner-friendly than other online classes I have followed.

## Applying for a promotion: a first time

For context, I am currently working in the local branch of a design agency. My direct manager—Senior Designer—was just promoted, which left the position open for internal applications. 

For the first time in my life, I applied last week for a promotion. 

It felt weird. It felt weird to write a *formal* cover letter to people you are seeing everyday. It felt weird to know that you were somehow in competition with your closest colleagues and friends.

Let's see where it goes. I definitely gave my best shot.
