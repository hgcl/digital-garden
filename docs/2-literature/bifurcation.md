When talking about career paths, *bifurcating* is a term created by Maloney in his article [[Dont quit your day job (2019)]].

It is when your divde your time between a stable job and a side activity—that you would rather pursue as a *main career*.

Bifurcating is a compromise between the more stable "having a family and some savings" world and the riskier "following your passion" choice.

## Is it bad to bifurcate?

> I wouldn’t dare to advise young idealists either to follow or not to follow their dreams. At the most, I might advise them to be wary of career preachers, whether radical or conservative, and that, while they shouldn’t fear commitment and leaps of faith, they also shouldn’t fear compromise.

It is completly fine to not know where you are going, to be in the in-between. "Simply follow your passion" preachers might be as toxic as their too conservative counterparts.
