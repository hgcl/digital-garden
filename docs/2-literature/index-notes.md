# Index Notes

*Warning: [[Not Based On An Original Source]]*

An index note is a type of note that is part of the [[Zettelkasten Method]].

After a while, a Zettelkasten can feel chaotic as it might mix notes about completely different topics. An index note comes into play to organize these notes by clusters.

There can be two levels of index notes:
1. The outline of an article or chapter
2. The outline of a book

## Index Notes As Outlines Of Chapters

This is the most straightforward type of index notes. After nurturing your Zettelkasten for a while, you might detect  clusters of notes.

Structure these notes into a table of content that could be the outline to a book chapter or an article.

There you go, you have your first index note.

## Index Notes As Outlines Of Books

This level of index notes is at a higher level. [[Rebecca Williams]] calls them keyword notes.

In this higher level, the index note outlines an entire book with its chapters. In other words, this type of index note is made of other index notes.
