# Literature Notes

[[§Warning Not Based On An Original Source]]

_Tags: #literature_

A literature note is a type of note that is part of the [[Zettelkasten Method]].

Literature notes stem from [[fleeting notes]] that have passed the curation filter. A literature note encompasses only one atomic idea or concept. Therefore, one fleeting note might lead to multiple literature notes.

A literature note follows the following four criteria:
1. One literature note represents one atomic idea.
2. It should be written in your own words.
3. Write it in a way that you would understand it in 10 years.
4. Always include references inline (Ahrens, 2017, pp.110) and at the end of your note (eg. Ahrens, S. (2017). How to take smart notes: One simple technique.)
