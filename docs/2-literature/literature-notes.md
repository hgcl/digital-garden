# Literature Notes

*Warning: [[Not Based On An Original Source]]*

A literature note is a type of note that is part of the [[Zettelkasten Method]].

Literature notes stem from [[fleeting notes]] that have passed the curation filter. A literature note encompasses only one atomic idea or concept. Therefore, one fleeting note might lead to multiple literature notes.

A literature note follows the following four criteria:
1. One literature note represents one atomic idea.
2. It should be written in your own words.
3. Write it in a way that you would understand it in 10 years.
4. Always include references inline (Ahrens, 2017, pp.110) and at the end of your note (eg. *Ahrens, S. (2017). How to take smart notes: One simple technique.*)
