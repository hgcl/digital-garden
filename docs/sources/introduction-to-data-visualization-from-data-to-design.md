### Typography
- Legibility above all! Personality is second
- Condensed and narrow typefaces to be able to write a lot of information in a condensed space
- Typography that you "do not see" and doesn't take your attention away from the information
- Make sure that the labels is read after the seeing visualization â€” less contrast, more subtle
- When choosing a typeface, think about:
  - Old style vs Lining figures
  - Proportional vs Tabular figures (align vertically)
  - Improper vs Proper fraction

### Color
- Use HSB: scale a color by moving one of these three measures
- Something less important: less saturation / bold, less contrast
- Use a smaller palettes by using patterns: dots, hashes
