# Protestant Work Ethic Lead To Capitalism

“Protestants, beginning with Martin Luther, reconceptualized worldly work as a duty which benefits both the individual and society as a whole. Thus, the Catholic idea of good works was transformed into an obligation to consistently work diligently as a sign of grace.”&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>

The Protestant work ethic makes it necessary to work hard and be frugal to be one of the elects—to be one of those that will be saved by God.

This resulted in a community where people valued hard-work and little spending, enabling its followers to be financially successful. Weber argues that these two values played a big part in shaping the western world and might have even lead to capitalism.

Nowadays, your value as a person is often closely connected to your job. Indulgence is seen as inherently bad. Many frown upon the idea of a "basic income" as you "need to have a job and do your part in the world".
