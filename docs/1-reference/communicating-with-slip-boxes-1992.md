# Communicating With Slip Boxes (1992)

## Notes
- [[Zettelkasten Method]]
- Birth of a [[Second Brain]]
  - > As a result of extensive work with this technique a kind of secondary memory will arise, an alter ego with who we can constantly communicate. It proves to be similar to our own memory in that it does not have a thoroughly constructed order of its entirety, not hierarchy, and most certainly no linear structure like a book. Just because of this, it gets its own life, independent of its author.
- Linking notes
  - Better to formulate problems so that heterogenous notes are linked together
