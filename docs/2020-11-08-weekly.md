# 2020-11-08 Weekly  

Yay! First weekly post—I have approximately 15 minutes to finish as I am making some [vareniki](https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/05/potato-vareniki/) at the same time.  

## Why this weekly post? 

I am feeling pretty inspired by [Salman Ansari's very personal newsletter](https://brownfox.substack.com/). I definitely don't feel confident enough to publish my own public newsletter. Yet, I do like the idea of a weekly "one shot post" that keeps you accountable of what you are doing in life—whatever that may be.   

## The objective

From today onward, I will protect this space in time to reflect on what I discovered, created, felt the past week. My current goal is to keep it simple: let's build the habit first.

I would love to write more today, but my vareniki are calling for attention. 

Talk soon,

Clara
