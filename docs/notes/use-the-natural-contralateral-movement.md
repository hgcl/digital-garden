# Use The Natural Contralateral Movement

To understand how we intuitively climb, we need to study how we naturally move. The basis behind using muscles from opposite sides stems from contralateral movement, a pattern that occurs naturally in humans.

The general rule is to use opposite hand with opposite foot.

## How Does It Work?

When climbing a ladder, we use the left-hand at the same time as the right-foot. Opposite hand and foot hold onto the rungs (and move) synchronously.

Using muscles from opposite sides allows us to balance and stabilise the left and right side of the body.

## When To Use It?

When two holds are on the same vertical plane, using opposite hand and foot avoids the _barn door_ effect â€” when your body swings out like a door.

Using opposite hand and foot brings our center of gravity within our base of support and creates a more stable balance.
