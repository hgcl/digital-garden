## Social Medias Profit From Our Biological Weaknesses

Humans have a basic biological imperative to connect with other people that directly affects the release of dopamine in the reward pathway.

Millions of years of evolution are behind that system to get us to come together and live in communities, to find mates, to propagate our species.

So, there's no doubt that a vehicle like social media, which optimizes this connection between people, is going to have the potential for addiction.

## We Are The Product

We don't pay with money when using social media. Advitsers pay for that use. This means that we are the product sold to advertisers.

## We Are Worth More Looking At Ads

Aza Raskin explains how social medias get to know us:

> People have the misconception it's our data being sold. It's not in Facebook's business interest to give up the data. What do they do with that data? They build models that predict our actions, and whoever has the best model wins.

Based on this model, the business model of most of these platforms is to sell our attention (and behavior change) to advertisers.

For social medias, we are worth more as zombies, looking at ads, than living our life.
