# A Note Status

_Tags: #budding_

## Inbox

The inbox gathers all transient notes, drafts and fleeting ideas (that I don't want to be fleeting anymore).

A new note always starts with the tag `#inbox`, it will then get reworked and switched to the next status â€“ or possibly deleted.

## Budding

Notes having been more or less become `#budding`. These notes are usually ideas or concepts that are still being fleshed out.

## Evergreen

An `#evergreen` note is considered completed.

It is possible to update an evergreen note, but it will have already been fleshed out at least once.
