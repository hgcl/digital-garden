# General Argument Patterns of Denialists

[[Denialists]] always use the same general pattern of arguments to defend their point of view. We can divide them in six categories:

  1. Doubt the Science
  2. Question Scientists’ Motives and Integrity
  3. Magnify Disagreements among Scientists and Cite [[Gadflies]] as Authorities
  4. Exaggerate Potential Harm
  5. Appeal to Personal Freedom
  6. Reject Whatever Would Repudiate A Key Philosophy
