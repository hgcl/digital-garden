- Definition of information design
  - > The selection of the presentation method and a layout for the information, taking into account the capabilities and limitations of the visual system, is called information design.
  - > Information design is about presenting information in the clearest way possible. According to the definition suggested by the researcher Robert E. Horn (2000), information design is “the art and science of preparing information so that it can be used by human beings with efficiency and effectiveness.” Clarifying the structure of data presented in written form or in a table also falls under this definition, but the concept refers above all to creating visual displays of information. Information design consists of selecting, organizing and presenting information, taking into account the needs and characteristics of the selected target audience, and the context of use.
