# Becoming A Magician

- Becoming great by building a [[habit-of-progression.md]] (linear) vs. [[ignoring-your-path-to-become-a-magician.md]] requiring an impossible jump, therefore needing to forget your path
- Both are actually similar: 
  - The habit of progression only takes into account the short-term. The incremental changes that you can make to your life to become better. 'If I did this thing everyday for a year, would I be a good person?'
  - On the other hand, the [[magician]] is the long-term vision. That's the reason why it may seem impossible and unattainable.
- Parallel with business approach
  - You need a business vision even though it may seem impossible / utopic.
  - Not because vision seems impossible that you shouldn't have a strategy for today. You need to align it with the vision.
