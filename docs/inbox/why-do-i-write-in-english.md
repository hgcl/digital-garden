# Why Do I Write in English

_Tags: #inbox_

- Most of the content I read is in English, it sometimes feels like a bigger chore to try translating English terms into French. For instance, do you say *jardin digital* in French?
- The internet is English-focused. If I want to write an article on Medium, it would be much easier for me to piece a post together with English written notes.
- Affirnative and straightforward titles are easier to write in English than in French.
