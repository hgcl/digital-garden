# Don’t quit your day job by T. Maloney (2019)

## Thoughts

 > I wouldn’t dare to advise young idealists either to follow or not to follow their dreams. At the most, I might advise them to be wary of career preachers, whether radical or conservative, and that, while they shouldn’t fear commitment and leaps of faith, they also shouldn’t fear compromise.
 
 - It is okay to not know where you are going, to be in the in-between. The extreme is not necessarily positive.
 - "Simply follow your passion" preachers might not be much better than their conservative counterparts.
