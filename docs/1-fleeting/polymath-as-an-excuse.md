# Polymath As An Excuse

While reading [[how-to-be-great-just-be-good-repeatably-by-s-smith-2020.md]], the following sentence resonated with me:
> It’s easy to pivot from side project to side project, focusing on the new shiny object of the month.

Is saying that I am a polymath and that I get bored easily of one single topic / project—therefore jumping from project to project—not a simple excuse?

Do I say that as a way to lessen the fact that I am simply not ready to commit and build great habits?
